@title[#:tag "broadcasting"]{Broadcasting}

A @deftech{broadcast} is a global @tech{pipeline} that can be controlled through the Overscan DSL, and provides a global event bus.

@defproc[(make-broadcast [video-source (is-a?/c element%)]
                         [audio-source (is-a?/c element%)]

                         (or/c (is-a?/c pipeline%) #f)]{
  Create a @tech{pipeline} that encodes a @racket[video-source] into h264 with @racket[h264-encoder], an @racket[audio-source] into aac with @racket[aac-encoder], muxes them together into an flv, and then sends that final flv to the @racket[flv-sink].
}

@defproc[(broadcast [video-source (is-a?/c element%) (videotestsrc)]
                    [audio-source (is-a?/c element%) (audiotestsrc)]

                    (is-a?/c pipeline%)]{
  Like @racket[make-broadcast], this procedure creates a pipeline, but will then call @racket[start] to promote it to the current @tech{broadcast}.
}

@defproc[(get-current-broadcast) (is-a?/c pipeline%)]{
  Gets the current @tech{broadcast} or raises an error if there is none.
}

@defproc[(start [pipeline (is-a?/c pipeline%)]) thread?]{
  Transforms the given @racket[pipeline] into the current @tech{broadcast} by creating an event listener on its @tech{bus} and setting its state to @racket['playing]. The returned thread is the listener polling the pipeline's bus.
}

@defproc[(on-air?) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] if there is a current broadcast, @racket[#f] otherwise.
}

@defproc[(stop [#:timeout timeout exact-nonnegative-integer? 5])
         (one-of/c 'failure 'success 'async 'no-preroll)]{
  Stops the current @tech{broadcast} by sending an @tech{EOS} event. If the state of the pipeline cannot be changed within @racket[timeout] seconds, an error will be raised.
}

@defproc[(kill-broadcast) void?]{
  Stops the current @tech{broadcast} without waiting for a downstream @tech{EOS}.
}

@defproc[(add-listener [listener (-> message? (is-a?/c pipeline%) any)])
         exact-nonnegative-integer?]{
}

@defproc[(remove-listener [id exact-nonnegative-integer?]) void?]{
}

@defproc[(graphviz [path path-string?]) any]{
}

@defthing[overscan-logger logger?]{
  A @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{logger} with a topic called @racket['Overscan]. Used by Overscan's event bus to log messages.
}

@section{Twitch}

@defmodule[overscan/twitch]

@hyperlink["https://www.twitch.tv/"]{Twitch.tv} is a live streaming community. To broadcast to Twitch, get a stream key from the dashboard settings and use it as a parameter to @racket[twitch-sink] with @racket[twitch-stream-key].

@defparam[twitch-stream-key key string?
          #:value (getenv "TWITCH_STREAM_KEY")]{
  A parameter that defines the current stream key for broadcasting to Twitch.tv.
}

@defproc[(twitch-sink [#:test bandwidth-test? boolean? #f]) rtmpsink?]{
  Create a @tech{rtmpsink} set up to broadcast upstream data to Twitch.tv. If @racket[bandwidth-test?] is @racket[#t], the stream will be configured to run a test, and won't be broadcast live. This procedure can be parameterized with @racket[twitch-stream-key].
}

@section{macOS}

@defmodule[overscan/macos]

Overscan was developed primarily on a computer running macOS. This module provides special affordances for working with Apple hardware and frameworks.

Putting all the pieces together, to broadcast a camera and a microphone to Twitch, preview the video, and monitor the audio, you would call:

@codeblock{
  #lang overscan
  (require overscan/macos)

  (call-atomically-in-run-loop (Î» ()
    (broadcast (camera 0)
               (audio 0)
               (twitch-sink)
               #:preview (osxvideosink)
               #:monitor (osxaudiosink))))
}

@defthing[audio-sources (vectorof (is-a?/c device%))]{
  A vector of input audio devices available.
}

@defthing[camera-sources (vectorof (-> (is-a?/c element%)))]{
  A vector of factory procedures for creating elements that correspond with the camera devices available.
}

@defthing[screen-sources (vectorof (-> (is-a?/c element%)))]{
  A vector of factory procedures for creating elements that correspond with the screen capture devices available.
}

@defproc[(audio [pos exact-nonnegative-integer?]) (is-a?/c element%)]{
  Finds the audio device in slot @racket[pos] of @racket[audio-sources] and creates a source element corresponding to it.
}

@defproc[(camera [pos exact-nonnegative-integer?]) (is-a?/c element%)]{
  Finds the camera device in slot @racket[pos] of @racket[camera-sources] and creates a source element corresponding to it.
}

@defproc[(screen [pos exact-nonnegative-integer?]
                 [#:capture-cursor cursor? boolean? #f]
                 [#:capture-clicks clicks? boolean? #f]) (is-a?/c element%)]{
  Finds the screen capture device in slot @racket[pos] of @racket[screen-sources] and creates a source element corresponding to it. When @racket[cursor?] or @racket[clicks?] are @racket[#t], the element will track the cursor or register clicks respectively.
}

@defproc[(osxvideosink [name (or/c string? #f) #f]) (element/c "osxvideosink")]{
  Creates an element for rendering input into a macOS window. Special care needs to be taken to make sure that the Racket runtime plays nicely with this window. See @racket[call-atomically-in-run-loop].
}

@defproc[(osxaudiosink [name (or/c string? #f) #f]) (element/c "osxaudiosink")]{
  Creates an element for rendering audio samples through a macOS audio output device.
}

@defproc[(call-atomically-in-run-loop [thunk (-> any)]) any]{
  Because of the idiosyncrasies of Racket, GStreamer, and Cocoa working together in concert, wrap the state change of a pipeline that includes a @racket[osxvideosink] in @racket[thunk] and call with this procedure, otherwise the program will crash. I don't fully understand the Cocoa happening underneath the hood, but a good rule of thumb is that if you have a @racket[broadcast] that includes @racket[osxvideosink], wrap it in this procedure before calling it.
}
