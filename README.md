# Chyron

A study in live video broadcasting with
the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) programming language.

No relation to the [ChyronHego](http://chyronhego.com) Corporation…

The goal of this project is to learn Racket and to better understand
the problems involved in:

+ The Real-Time Messaging Protocol
  ([RTMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol))
  and constructing and streaming unbounded audio and video feeds.
+ The [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv)
  and
  [Facebook Live](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/videos/live-video) API's,
  for authentication, broadcasting live video streams, and gathering
  audience data.
+ Video compositing in software.

The end-goal is to build a toolkit like that found
in [StreamPro](https://streampro.io)
or [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com) (née _TwitchAlerts_) but using
a Racket DSL for on-the-fly compositing and graphics.

This is a domain I am unfamiliar with, and it's unclear where a tool
like [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com) begins and
the aforementioned stream tools end. Over the life of this project the
feature set is likely to evolve and blend into these other areas.

This project is inspired by other live-coding environments
like
[Impromptu](http://impromptu.moso.com.au)/[Extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) and
[Overtone](http://overtone.github.io).
